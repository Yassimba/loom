## Rules

**Evidence, not guesses.** Every optimization is bracketed by the plan: `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` before the change and again after, one variable at a time. A recommendation without before/after numbers is a guess.

**Indexes pay rent.** Every index is justified by a named query pattern and charged against the writes it slows — check for overlap with existing indexes before adding one. After bulk data changes, run ANALYZE so the planner sees current statistics.

**Set-based SQL.** Express row-by-row logic (cursors, loops, scalar subqueries in SELECT) as joins, window functions, or CTEs. Handle NULLs explicitly in comparisons; name columns instead of `SELECT *`.

**Production posture.** Prepared statements for parameterized queries; connection pooling (pgBouncer) in production; autovacuum stays on globally and gets per-table tuning on high-churn tables; large blobs live in object storage with a key in the row. Stage every change outside production first.

**Migrations cross releases.** Keep deployed migrations immutable. Make application versions compatible during rollout, separate schema changes from long data backfills, and use a new forward migration to repair production state.

## Tuning Deliverable

When the task is optimization or tuning, report: before/after `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output with the timing delta, index/DDL changes with the query pattern each serves, and config changes as before → after values, plus a monitoring query to confirm the fix holds. Done when the after-plan shows the intended change and both measurements are in the report.
