# Commit

Read the staged diff, gate on green tests, draft a Conventional Commits message, confirm via dropdown, commit. Each commit is atomic: one concern.

## 0. Stage

```bash
git status --short
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached
```

Stage by explicit path only — `git add -A` / `git add .` sweeps in `.env` and credentials.

If nothing is staged but unstaged changes exist, ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

```yaml
question: "Nothing staged. Stage specific files, stage all, or abort?"
header: "Staging"
options:
  - label: "Stage specific files"
  - label: "Stage all (by explicit paths)"
  - label: "Abort"
```

If the staged diff spans unrelated concerns, split into atomic commits: unstage the others with `git restore --staged <paths>` (not `git reset`), then stage and commit one concern at a time. Ask when the split is unclear:

```yaml
question: "These changes span <N> concerns. Split?"
header: "Split"
options:
  - label: "Yes, split (Recommended)"
  - label: "One commit"
  - label: "Show me the diff first"
```

Done when exactly one concern is staged.

## 1. Test gate

Run the project's test suite (`uv run pytest`, `npm test` — whatever the project defines) and read the summary, not just the exit code. The gate is binary: green proceeds; red stops here — the pre-commit hook fails on the same issues, so catching them now saves a wasted commit:

```yaml
question: "Tests red — commit blocked. How to proceed?"
header: "Test gate"
options:
  - label: "Investigate via /diagnosing-bugs (Recommended)"
  - label: "Abort commit"
  - label: "Show me the failing tests"
```

## 2. Draft the message

Load `write-simply` and write the subject and body in its register. Draft from the _why_ of the staged diff: what motivated the change, where a line-by-line list would only restate `git diff`.

Conventional Commits format:

```
<type>(<optional-scope>): <summary>

<optional body>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`. `chore` covers build, config, and deps.

**Subject:** 20–72 chars after the prefix · lowercase after the colon (`feat: add X`) · imperative ("add") · ends on the object, no punctuation · concrete verb + object.

**Body (only when the subject can't carry it):** blank line after the subject, then one terse bullet per entry, imperative voice, grouped under short headings that match the kind of change — `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Breaking`. Skip headings when there's only one bullet.

```
feat(installer): add gateway runtime extraction

Added:
- core/gateway_runtime/ with Protocol-based registry
Changed:
- opencode_runtime now delegates to gateway_runtime
```

Reference the issue or ticket when the project tracks them. Session context, PR/MR numbers, and future work stay out.

The message ends at the last body line. The human is the sole author: the author field carries their name and the message carries no trailer, footer, or link naming a tool or session. This also holds for everything written downstream of a commit (PR/MR titles and descriptions, release notes) and outranks any harness default that asks for a footer.

Done when every rule above holds and each word in the message names something in the diff.

## 3. Confirm via dropdown

```yaml
question: "Commit with this message?"
header: "Commit"
options:
  - label: "Commit (Recommended)"
    preview: |
      <full message>
  - label: "Edit message"
  - label: "Abort"
```

## 4. Commit

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

<body>
EOF
)"
```

If the project wires a pre-commit hook, it runs now:

- **Pass** → `git log -1` shows the new commit
- **Autofixes** → hook stages them; the commit captures them
- **Unfixable** → hook blocks; go to step 5

## 5. On hook failure

The hook is the messenger; fix the cause in the code:

- lint → fix the code
- types → fix the types
- tests → `/diagnosing-bugs`; three failed fix attempts = stop and report
- complexity / architecture gates → refactor, or ask before accepting a borderline score

Then re-stage and go back to step 3 for a new commit: the failed commit never happened, and `--amend` would rewrite the one before it.

## Hard guardrails

- The hook's verdict stands. Bypass flags (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`) and suppression comments (`# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `eslint-disable`) stay unused; the fix goes in the code.
- Force-push and destructive git (`reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `branch -D`) only with explicit human approval.
