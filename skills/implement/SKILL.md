Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

Invoke /ponytail make sure to always try to reuse AS MUCH of the existing code as possible when designing the solution

Before writing any code, use the blueprint skill to show what you intend to build and get approval. Skip only for trivial changes — a rename, a one-line fix.

Use /tdd where possible, at pre-agreed seams. A ticket's "Rules & examples" map is the scenario list — one test per example.

Once done, use /code-review to review the work.

Commit your work to the current branch.
